# BuildSim

Building simulation server with REST API and WebSocket session control. A single Go binary embeds building floor plan data, a 3D web viewer, and SVG equipment icons.

## Quick Start

```bash
make          # build to bin/buildsim
make run      # build and start on port 9090
make run-edit # build and start with editing enabled
make test     # run all tests with race detector
```

Open http://localhost:9090 in **Chrome** or Firefox to view the 3D building. Safari blocks WebSocket connections over plain HTTP, which prevents real-time updates.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 3D Building Viewer | Multi-floor building visualization with pan, zoom, and orbit controls |
| REST API | Full CRUD for equipment, sensors, and actuators |
| Session Control | Programmatic control of the viewer (viewport, highlights, occupancy, routes, coverage zones) via REST + WebSocket |
| Navigation Graph | Walkable corridor graph with Dijkstra shortest path routing, single and cross-floor |
| Equipment Icons | 50 detailed SVG icons for all equipment types, loaded dynamically |
| Occupancy | Person, group, and alien (xenomorph) icons rendered in rooms via session API |
| Living Building | ~60 simulated people follow a weekly schedule through the real rooms; occupancy, temperature, CO2 and energy follow them |
| MCP Server | Model Context Protocol server for AI-controlled building manipulation |
